.SH "NAME"
\fBblueprint\-create\fR \- create a blueprint
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBblueprint create\fR [\fB\-d\fR \fIsubtrahend\fR] [\fB\-P\fR|\fB\-C\fR|\fB\-S\fR|\|\.\|\.\|\.] [\fB\-m\fR \fImessage\fR] [\fB\-r\fR] [\fB\-q\fR] \fIname\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBblueprint\-create\fR creates a list of all installed packages and modified configuration files and stores it in the branch \fIname\fR in the local blueprint repository with the commit \fImessage\fR (if given)\.
.
.P
If standard input is not a TTY, a blueprint is read from standard input rather than created from the system\. See \fBblueprint\fR(5) for the details of the format\.
.
.P
If a \fIsubtrahend\fR is given, it is subtracted from the generated or provided blueprint and the difference is committed as \fIname\fR\.
.
.P
If one of \fB\-\-puppet\fR, \fB\-\-chef\fR, \fB\-\-bcfg2\fR, \fB\-\-sh\fR, or \fB\-\-cfn\fR is given, a Puppet module, a Chef cookbook, a bcfg2 repository, POSIX shell code, or an AWS CloudFormation template will be generated, written to a file or directory in the current working directory, and its filename will be printed to standard output\.
.
.P
Debian packages, Ruby gems, NPM packages, Python packages, PHP PEAR/PECL packages are enumerated in the blueprint\.
.
.P
The contents of system configuration files in \fB/etc\fR that have been created or modified from their packaged versions will be included in the blueprint\. If file is found to have a corresponding template (a file with "\fB\.blueprint\-template\.mustache\fR" appended to its pathname) and optionally a corresponding data script (a file with "\fB\.blueprint\-template\.sh\fR" appended to its pathname), this \fBtemplate\fR and \fBdata\fR are included in the blueprint rather than the file\'s literal content\.
.
.P
Anything installed in \fB/usr/local\fR will be archived and included in the blueprint, tagged with the architecture of the local system\.
.
.P
\fBblueprintignore\fR(5) provides means for ignoring specific files and packages plus treating arbitrary directories as \fB/usr/local\fR is treated\.
