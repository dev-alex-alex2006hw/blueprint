blueprint-show-files(1) -- show files in a blueprint
====================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`blueprint show-files` [`-q`] [_name_]  

## DESCRIPTION

`blueprint-show-files` prints the fully-qualified pathname of each configuration file (always in `/etc`) in the blueprint _name_.  They are printed one-per-line to make this command useful in pipelines.

If _name_ is omitted or `-`, a blueprint is read from standard input and treated in the same manner.  See `blueprint`(5) for the details of the format.
